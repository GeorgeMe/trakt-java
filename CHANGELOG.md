Change Log
==========

1.0.1 *(In Development)*
------------------------

 * Fix deserialization of fields whose names contained underscores.
 * `getEpisodes()` in `TvShowSeason` is now a complex type that can hold both
   a count and an episode number list.
 * Add new properties to `Movie` and `TvShow`.
 * Some dates are now a `java.util.Calendar` where the precision is to the
   seconds. Ones that remain `java.util.Date` should only be used for the date
   they represent, not the time.
 * The search service is now available from `ServiceManager`.
 * __Full test suite implemented__.


1.0.0 *(2011-07-01)*
